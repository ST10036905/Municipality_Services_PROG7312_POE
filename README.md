# Municipality_Services_PROG7321_POE
The following C# application is being designed to allow for citizens to report any issues related to their municipality/location. The main feature which is being implemented is the "Report Issues" which is a form extensively focused on user input (location, description of problem, category it falls into and the media) which then will enable them to be addressed. 
The application also has as a focal point the provision of a user friendly interface to encourage for the active user engagement through the implementation of interactive features.

Steps on how to run and compile the application :
1 - Opening the folder on visual studio - The user should first have visual studio installed. The following folder should be extracted and visual studio opened. Once you open visual studio, select open a project or solution from the start screen and proceed to opening the folder by navigating to the .sln fine, which is the solution file. 
2 - Building the project - Once the project is loaded, there is a menu on the top with the Build option which should be selected, as follows, Build > Build solution. With this process, visual studio will compile the application which means that if there are any errors or warning, they will be displayed and hints for their resolutions provided, as to ensure a smooth running process.
3 - Run the application - Once the project is successfully built, any warning and errors resolved, the user can then run the application by clicking on Debug > Start without debugging , which will run the application.
4 - Testing and making use of the application - The application is now launched and a main menu is displayed with the options :
a. Report Issues
b. Local Events
c. Announcements
Optionally, there is a menu strip with the same options and an exit that will close the whole application. 
Once the user clicks on "report issues" or "apply now" on the menu strip, they will be redirected to a municipality form to fill and report any issues. 
It is mandatory that all fields are filled, the location, category, description of the issues, except the media which is optional. If not filled, an error box will be displayed, prompting the user that all fields are populated. 
Once the user has entered the data, they can proceed to the submit button which will store the data on a list for future use. If the user then wishes to view issues, "view applications" button redirects to a form that shows all the issues that have been populated in a grid view. Back button is responsible to redirect user back to the initial page, but it is only achieved if the user confirms with a confirm box. 
Now the project is successfully compiled and run as an application. 

***Further implementation - As a wholesome, the following were the features implemented in the following part of the application. Local events, announcements and service requests are still to be implemented with additional functionalities.
